Rules:

The player is placed in a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posts which can be electrified too.
There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy the player.

If the player touches the maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game (and the player!).
Moves onto dead robots or non electrified posts are not valid and, therefore, not possible.

For every player move, each robot will move one cell closer to the new player's location.
The robots have no vision sensors but they have an accurate odour sensor that allows them to follow the player!
This means that the robot will only ever take the shortest path to the player, regardless of obstacles.

The robots are also destroyed when they touch the fences/posts or when they collide with each other.

The way to win is to exit the maze.

Identifiers:

Each entity is represented by a symbol on the game map.
Players are "H" when they are alive, "h" when dead.
Robots are "R" when alive, "r" when dead.
Fences and electrified posts are "*", while non electrified posts are "+".

Controls:

Use S to stay in the same place, W and X to move vertically, A and D to move horizontally and Q, E, Z and C to move diagonally.
